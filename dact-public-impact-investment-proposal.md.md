# DACT Framework: Public Impact Investment Proposal
## Autonomous AI for Planetary Recovery and Crisis Prevention

---

## Executive Overview

**Investment Opportunity**: $50M Series A funding to develop and deploy the Decentralized Autonomous Continuity Terminal (DACT), a revolutionary AI framework designed to autonomously prevent and resolve global crises while generating sustainable returns through impact-driven solutions.

**Market Opportunity**: The global climate technology market is projected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030, with disaster management and prevention representing a $180 billion annual market. DACT addresses both markets through a unified autonomous platform.

**Unique Value Proposition**: First-to-market self-governing AI system capable of transforming incomplete research into deployable solutions for climate, disaster, and economic crises without human intervention delays.
